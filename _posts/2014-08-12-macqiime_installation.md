---layout: pagetitle: "MacOS Users: Installing MacQIIME"date: 2014-08-12 08:55:36---These directions are slightly modified from [those provided by the Werner lab](http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime/macqiime-installation).Please note:* You must have administrator access on a computer to install MacQIIME.* You must install R and the required dependency packages.  We recommend that you install R before installing MacQIIME.### Installing MacQIIME<ol><li>Download the tgz archive: [http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime](http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime).  The current version of QIIME is 1.8.0.  Save the archive (do not open with Archive Utility).  It should automatically be saved in the Downloads directory.![IMG1](img/macqiime/IMG1.png)</li><li>Open your computer's terminal. <strong>Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal</strong></li><li>Navigate to the Downloads directory (where the archive was saved), using the `cd` (change directory) command:`cd ~/Downloads`</li><li>Check that the file was not corrupted using the “md5” command (message digest 5).  This command provides the sum of the “hashes” to determine the size of the file.  The idea is that if the file were corrupted during download (missing some pieces), the output will be different.  See the “MD5 hashes” section of [this Wikipedia article for an example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5):To do this, you would type:`md5 MacQIIME_1.8.0-20140103_OS10.6.tgz`The computer should return the following:`MD5 (MacQIIME_1.8.0-20140103_OS10.6.tgz) = 9f1175e0a0ba71ebe6bb5d9b7bb0e6c2`Check carefully that the number above matches exactly your output.  If it does not, discard the downloaded file (move to trash, empty trash), and start over with an uncorrupted or complete download.</li><li>Now you will want to unarchive using the tar command:`tar -xvf MacQIIME_1.8.0-20140103_OS10.6.tgz`This will show a list of file contents as they are extracted from the archive:![IMG2](img/macqiime/IMG2.png)Unarchiving the file will automatically create a new directory called “MacQIIME_1.8.0-20140103_OS10.6”.  Use `cd` to move into that directory:`cd MacQIIME_1.8.0-20140103_OS10.6/`</li><li>Use the “ls” command (list) to view the files in that directory:`ls`The computer will return the following:`README.txt	install.s	macqiime	scripts`Run the install.s script to install most of what is needed to run QIIME. Use the command:`./install.s`Then, the script will prompt you to agree to write-over the old directory.![IMG3](img/macqiime/IMG3.png)As we are starting from scratch this is okay, and you may hit enter.  In the future, if you upgrade to a new QIIME version, it is recommend that you save the older version before upgrading.  [There are directions for saving the old version of MacQIIME](http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime/macqiime-installation).Then, you will be prompted for a password.  This is where administrator access (`sudo`) is needed:![IMG4](img/macqiime/IMG4.png)After you type in your password, and the script will do its thing!At the end, the terminal look like:![IMG5](img/macqiime/IMG5.png)</li></ol>### Installing the fastq-join and SeqPrep toolsThis MacQIIME add-on is for joining paired-end Illumina reads.<ol><li>Download the tgz archive:[http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime/add-fastq-join-to-macqiime-1-8-0](http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime/add-fastq-join-to-macqiime-1-8-0).</li><li>Save the archive (do not open with Archive Utility).  The archive (“Add_ea-tools_to_MacQIIME-1.8.0.tgz”) should automatically be saved in the Downloads directory.![IMG6](img/macqiime/IMG6.png)</li><li>In terminal, navigate back to the Downloads directory by typing:`cd ~/Downloads/`<li>As before, unarchive:`tar -xvf Add_ea-tools_to_MacQIIME-1.8.0.tgz`![IMG7](img/macqiime/IMG7.png)<li>Then, use “cd” to navigate into the new directory:`cd Add_ea-tools_to_MacQIIME-1.8.0/`</li><li>Run the installation script:`./install.script`You will again be prompted for the administrative password.  There is no special message that is returned when the installation is complete, but you will know by the “$” at the end of your userid, which means that the computer is ready for your next command.![IMG8](img/macqiime/IMG8.png)</li></ol>
